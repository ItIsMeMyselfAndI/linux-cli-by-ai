## 11.1 Advanced Command-Line Tips

- **Command History and Reuse**
  - Press <kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd> to scroll through previous commands.
  - Use `history` to see all past commands.
  - Rerun the last command starting with `sudo`:
    ```bash
    sudo !!
    ```
    - `!!` repeats the last command.

- **Chaining Commands**
  - Run multiple commands in sequence:
    ```bash
    command1 && command2
    command1 || command2
    command1 ; command2
    ```
    - `&&` runs the second only if the first succeeds.
    - `||` runs the second if the first fails.
    - `;` runs them one after the other, regardless of success.

- **Redirecting Output**
  - Save command output to a file:
    ```bash
    ls -l > files.txt
    ```
    - `>` overwrites, `>>` appends.
  - Use pipes to combine commands:
    ```bash
    ls -l | grep ".sh"
    ```

- **Background and Long-Running Tasks**
  - Run a command in the background:
    ```bash
    ./longtask.sh &
    ```
    - The `&` lets you keep using the terminal.

  - Bring a background task to the foreground:
    ```bash
    fg
    ```

## 11.2 Customizing Your Shell

- **Edit your shell configuration**
  - For bash: `~/.bashrc`
  - For zsh: `~/.zshrc`
  - Add aliases, functions, and prompt customizations.

- **Example: Add an alias**
  ```bash
  echo "alias ll='ls -lah'" >> ~/.bashrc
  source ~/.bashrc
  ```
  - Now `ll` runs `ls -lah` for you.

## 11.3 Package Managers Beyond APT

- **Snap and Flatpak**: Install universal Linux apps.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    sudo snap install code --classic
    ```

- **pip**: Manage Python packages.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

- **npm**: Manage Node.js packages.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    npm install express
    ```
